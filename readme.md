### AppRTC - Kurento Example

This is a simple example project in nodejs to demonstrate the compatibility of the [AppRTCDemo](https://github.com/njovy/AppRTCDemo) Android App with the [Kurento Media Server](http://www.kurento.org/).

This server copies the API of an apprtc server so a mobile device running the AppRTCDemo App can communicate with a Webclient powered by kurento.

This is a proof of concept and not meant to be stable or complete.

It is heavily based on the [Kurento Example Apps](https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-node.git).

Tested with AppRTCDemo Version [b73a922be382193ec703c42284c448ff38107f11](https://github.com/njovy/AppRTCDemo/commit/b73a922be382193ec703c42284c448ff38107f11) on a Sony Xperia
